# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 23 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've Create React Native App Basix

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding in React Native , this is good because the application can render automatically if any change in code not like native app must install again if there are change in code
